      ☐ EMail Class
      ☐ Pagination Class
      ☐ Time Class
      ☐ Comments Class
      ☐ Forms Class
      ☐ ...

      Some of the classes, Pagination, Time, Forms can be lifted directly...
      Although Pagination & Comments will need some slight upgrades due to the new DBO structure.

    Misc:
      ☐ Get the Admin Panel up
      ☐ Get the Permissions System up (Using groups?)
      ☐ Get the module client system working (for all cms installs)
      ☐ Get the module server system working (for cs.org)
          (Within the admin panel, so client CMS' can report in and download new modules, themes and plugins on-the-fly)

      The Admin panel should work on a permissions basis per group.
      That was a user can define their own administratitive groups and assign each group thier own access rights.
